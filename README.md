- The purpose of this Web App is to basically let the businesses handle their timings by assigning appointments to their visitors! Currently, it just let's us create both the appointment and admins but its actual functionality is just to let some particular admins edit the appointments booked by customers. 
- I am still keeping an open approach to look around for idea improvements and enhance the user experience by adding the APIs and I'll also try to work on collaborating with local device calenders.
