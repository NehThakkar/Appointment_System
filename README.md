- The purpose of this Web App is to basically let the businesses handle their timings by assigning appointments to their visitors! Currently, it just let's us create both the appointment and admins but its actual functionality is just to let some particular admins edit the appointments booked by customers. 
- It currently has three different role identities : 
- - Admin Credentials (email : rich@gc.ca , password : Test123$) - Admins can access all the information including admins and customers with access to edit them all
- - Pharmacist Credentials (email : pharmacist@gc.ca , password : Test123$) - Pharmacists cannot edit or delete the dose admins (can see them) but edit the appointments
- - Customers Credentials (email : customer@gc.ca , password : Test123$) - Customers can just book appointments and see other appointments
- - Unknown Users - can only book appointments without having access to any of the information
- I am still keeping an open approach to look around for idea improvements and enhance the user experience by adding the APIs and I'll also try to work on collaborating with local device calenders.
